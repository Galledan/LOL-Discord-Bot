# LOL-Discord-Bot

A Discord Bot I made to improve myself and for my private Discord server. I named it many names but it's last name was Poro Bot.

## Features

* !build champion_name lane -> Gives the pictures of starting items and suggested items combined as one picture and sends it as a message (starting and suggested items are done seperately).
